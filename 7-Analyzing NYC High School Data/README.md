The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test that high school seniors in the U.S. take every year. 
The SAT has three sections, each of which is worth a maximum of 800 points. 
Colleges use the SAT to determine which students to admit. High average SAT scores are usually indicative of a good school.
