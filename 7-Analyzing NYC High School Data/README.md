# Analyzing NYC High School Data

The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test that high school seniors in the U.S. take every year. 
The SAT has three sections, each of which is worth a maximum of 800 points. 
Colleges use the SAT to determine which students to admit. High average SAT scores are usually indicative of a good school.  

New York City has published data on student SAT scores by high school, along with additional demographic data sets.  
* __SAT scores by school__ - SAT scores for each high school in New York City
* __School attendance__ - Attendance information for each school in New York City
* __Class size__ - Information on class size for each school
* __AP test results__ - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)
* __Graduation outcomes__ - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information
* __Demographics__ - Demographic information for each school
* __School survey__ - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school  

New York City has a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair test. For example, if certain racial groups consistently perform better on the SAT, we would have some evidence that the SAT is unfair.  

The dataframe combined contains all of the data we'll be using in our analysis.
