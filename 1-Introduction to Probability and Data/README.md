## The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS):
is a collaborative project between all of the States in the United States (US) and participating US territories and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
BRFSS is an ongoing surveillance system designed to measure behavioral risk factors for non-institutionalized adult population (18 years and older) residing in the US. The BRFSS was initiated in 1984, 
with 15 States collecting surveillance data on risk behaviors through monthly telephone interviews. 
Over time, the number of States participating in the survey increased, including also the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, 
Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau. They collect survey data over a limited point-in-time (usually one to three months). In this document, the term “state” is used to refer to all areas participating in BRFSS.

Factors assessed by the BRFSS in 2013 include tobacco use, HIV/AIDS knowledge and prevention, exercise, immunization, health status, healthy days — health-related quality of life, health care access, inadequate sleep, 
hypertension awareness, cholesterol awareness, chronic health conditions, alcohol consumption, fruits and vegetables consumption, arthritis burden, and seatbelt use. In conducting the BRFSS landline telephone survey, 
interviewers collect data from a randomly selected adult in a household. In conducting the cellular telephone version of the BRFSS questionnaire, 
interviewers collect data from an adult who participates by using a cellular telephone and resides in a private residence or college housing.

In 2013, additional question sets were included as optional modules to provide a measure for several childhood health and wellness indicators, including asthma prevalence for people aged 17 years or younger.
